# Devastation Evoker APL
Useful description

# Todo
- [ ] optimize shattering star priorities/pooling
  - might want to prevent casting FB inside star
- [ ] optimize fire breath usage
  - 'snapshot' by using higher rank FB inside buff windows (trinkets etc.)
  - the last FB inside DR before the boss dies should be cast at rank 4 (combine with TTS)
- [ ] optimize for no wasted procs
  - currently wastes about 5 essence and 1.5-2 burnout procs (see FTF/EB/Star/Caus build)
- [ ] fix trinket usage (double on use / 1 minute?)
  - first iteration is very basic but should good enough for now
  - trinkets that have to be casted before dragonrage are not handled at all at the moment (i.e. Shadowed Orb of Torment)
- [ ] gather data on realistic channel lag
