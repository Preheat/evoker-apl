# Devastation Evoker APL
Useful description

# Todo
- [ ] optimize shattering star priorities/pooling
  - might want to prevent casting FB inside star
- [ ] optimize fire breath usage
  - 'snapshot' by using higher rank FB inside buff windows (trinkets etc.)
  - the last FB inside DR before the boss dies should be cast at rank 4 (combine with TTS)
- [ ] optimize aoe
  - prefer higher rank FB (burnout is generally useless in aoe)
  - prefer lower rank ES to save on cast time? (needs testing)
- [ ] optimize for no wasted procs
  - currently wastes about 5 essence and 1.5-2 burnout procs (see FTF/EB/Star/Caus build)
- [ ] fix trinket usage (double on use / 1 minute?)
  - first iteration is very basic but should good enough for now
- [ ] gather data on realistic channel lag
